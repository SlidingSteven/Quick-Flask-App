# Quick Flask App

This summer I worked on a project that encorporated Flask, python scripts and bootstrap but I am not able to post it here becuase it was with a company.  This should give a lightweight proof of concept of what I can do at the moment and as time allows I would like to continue to build on this site.

Some things I want to encorporate as time goes on is-
- JS
- HTML/CSS Bootstrap pages
- SQL queries to display some data
- Possibly use an online API to do the same?

But for now I just want to make a base flask app that can be used as the root for a number of ideas.
